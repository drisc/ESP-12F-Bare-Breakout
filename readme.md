# ESP-12F Bare Breakout

This PCB breaks out the pins of ESP-12E/ESP-12F packages.
There are no resistors or circuitry to pull the 'Enable' pin HIGH or put the chips into flashing mode, it is just a breakout to make working with the chips easier so that you can build those circuits yourself.


I've included the library for the footprint of the ESP-12 under the libraries folder, to use it outside of this project look for 'ESP12E-SMD' in the library manager. Both the 'E' and 'F' board varients have the same pin layout.
